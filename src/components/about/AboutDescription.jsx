    <p>
        Hey, I am someone who is passionate about tech and loves solving complex problems. 
        I did my Btech. in Electronics Engineering but my interest in coding brought me into the 
        software engineering path. I have worked at Microsoft and am going to work at Google next.
        In my free time I love to read books and play badminton.
